# Subglacial outburst flood modelling

This repository models water flow through subglacial conduits representing a subglacial lake drainage.

The core model code is in the `models.py` module. The scripts `test_imposed_discharge.py`, `test_pressure_coupled.py` and `beta_sensitivity.py` test the model and carry out sensitivity tests.
